### A little about me
I was born on the Gold Coast to fourth generation British migrants and sadly only speak English though I enjoy learning words and phrases in other languages. I finished High School in 2000 and have started but not finished degree programs in Science, Maths, Physics, Law and Journalism. My partner and I have recently adopted a Greyhound rescued from the racing industry and it has brought the failings of this industry starkly into focus for me. I understand this is not intended as a forum for political discussion so I will not launch into a deep dissection of this, suffice to say #petsnotbets.

I have been interested in IT for a long time but more just as a curiosity. A couple of years ago I took over the maintenance and development of the POS database that we use in my workplace and I found it to be overly complex and not really fit for purpose. Through speaking with many people in the local industry it is clear that all of the current offerings have serious flaws and there is a huge potential for innovation in this space. It sparked an interest in programming and developing software that is powerful, useful, simple and intuitive.

My experience in IT professionally consists of on the job use of a broad range of mostly desktop applications including Excel, Publisher, Outlook and most of the Office suite. As a manager the use of HR management applications, specifically FoundU, as well as industry specific applications such as H&L Sysnet, Doshii, Chewzie and Microsoft RMS.

I was motivated to engage in a Bachelor of IT in order to transition into a career in IT. Given that I work full time it made sense to study online so I looked into Open Universities Australia and was pleasantly surprised that anyone can enrol in courses without meeting prerequisites. I chose RMIT based on research around the best offerings of IT degrees in Australia. RMIT was ranked very high amongst institutions in Australia offering a Bachelor of IT generally and was the highest ranked institution I could find offering this program online through OUA.

Through this program I aim hoping to learn a lot about programming and coding and also where my strengths and weaknesses in IT lie. It would be good to also get a solid understanding of web design and web based computing as it seems like this will become more and more common.
