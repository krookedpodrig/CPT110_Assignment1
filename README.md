### Personal Info
 
I was born on the Gold Coast to fourth generation British migrants and speak English as a first language with a decent handful words and phrases in other languages under my belt. Having finished High School in 2000, I have started but not finished degree programs in Science, Maths, Physics, Law and Journalism. My partner and I recently adopted a Greyhound rescued from the racing industry and it has brought the failings of this industry starkly into focus for me.

### Interest in IT

I have been interested in IT and computers for a long time but more just as a curiosity. A couple of years ago I took over the maintenance and development of the POS database that we use in my workplace and I found it to be overly complex and not really fit for purpose. Through speaking with many people in the local industry it is clear that all of the current offerings have serious flaws and there is a huge potential for innovation in this space. It sparked an interest in programming and developing software that is powerful and effective while also being simple and intuitive.

My experience in IT professionally consists of on the job use of a broad range of mostly desktop applications including Excel, Publisher, Outlook and most of the Office suite. As a manager the use of HR management applications, specifically FoundU, as well as industry specific applications such as H&L Sysnet, Doshii, Chewzie and Microsoft RMS.

I was motivated to engage in a Bachelor of IT in order to transition into a career in IT. Given that I work full time it made sense to study online so I looked into Open Universities Australia and was pleasantly surprised that anyone can enrol in courses without meeting prerequisites. I chose RMIT based on research around the best offerings of IT degrees in Australia. RMIT was ranked very high amongst institutions in Australia offering a Bachelor of IT generally and was the highest ranked institution I could find offering this program online through OUA.

Through this program I aim hoping to learn a lot about programming and coding and also where my strengths and weaknesses in IT lie. It would be good to also get a solid understanding of web design and web based computing as it seems like this will become more and more common.

### Ideal Job

DevOps Engineer

https://www.seek.com.au/job/53919807?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=c9878d1f-7e45-4037-b86b-91d1ff1e366c

This ad is for a position as a DevOps engineer. DevOps is the conduit between developers and operations teams. Developers are interested in developing and introducing updates and new software while operations teams are focused on the daily operations of the software and maintaining stability and reliability during transitions.

Using complex retail POS software on a daily basis I am very familiar with issues around troubleshooting and implementing updates. I am always communicating with the Managers and staff in order to identify weaknesses or errors in the system and then try to find effective solutions. I enjoy seeing the different ways people view and use the software and the different ideas that people have about what it should do and why.

I feel like DevOps would be an excellent fit or me as I am very keen to learn programming and development and I naturally have always been focused on how things actually appear to the user and their usability and reliability.

Some of the requirements for this role include a Bachelor of Computer Science or equivalent, technical knowledge of specific software and systems, experience working with GIT, literacy in coding languages and other industry experience. 

Personally I have only just started to use GIT and Python and don’t currently have experience with any of the specific software or systems.

The plan to put myself in position to obtain a job like this involves completing a Bachelor of IT online through OUA and working my way into the industry from there.

### IT Project Idea

Overview:

A happy hour and food or drink specials search app. An app that will work with a user’s GPS and maps to display ‘Happy Hours’ and drink or food deals in the users’ immediate area. The app would also contain the option to display a list sorted by distance, upcoming deals and a search function.
Motivation:
Often you are out and about around town and you are looking for a cheap meal or bargain drink deal. Using Google or Google Maps to look at each venue and peruse their website or Facebook page is time consuming and cumbersome. Having access to this information in one place would make the search quick and easy and allow you to make an informed choice with a minimum of fuss. Venues would contribute their information although would not be allowed to promote or ‘boost’ their impact in order to maintain a sense of independence in the information displayed.

Description:

Data would be collected directly from venues and compiled into a database containing several key identifiers including whether the deal is for food or drinks, the type of products available, location and time and day of offering. This would allow the user to filter the data according to what they are looking for and by default show only those deals that are currently available.
The app would require access to a user’s GPS location in order to provide information about the deals available in their immediate area. The app would then display an interactive map showing the user’s current location and the venues offering deals in that area. User’s who do not wish to share their location information would be given the option to use the map by panning and zooming to see what is available. 
By tapping on a venue the user would be shown information about the deal including products available and the time the offer is active along with the venue’s location and contact information. There would also be a link to the venue’s website and/or social media accounts.
User’s would be given the option to display a list of deals sorted by the distance to their current location with the closest first. Those users who do not wish to share their specific location could be given the option of tapping a spot on the map and displaying a similar list based on that spot.
There would also be an option to display upcoming deals based on a time input by the user. This would take the form of a time and date prompt.

Tools and technologies:

Some of the tools required include an interactive mapping tool, ability to use GPS data and powerful list sorting and filtering software.

Skills required:

The skills required include powerful coding and programming knowledge, including specifically the ability to write apps and to generate an interactive map.

Outcome:

If the app were successful, it would allow people to quickly and easily find hospitality deals available in their area and enable venues to offer deals to boost trade. It would encourage people to seek out new venues and potentially discover new places and experiences.
